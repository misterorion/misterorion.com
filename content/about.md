I’m Orion Anderson, a certified cloud professional living in New York City. I hold all three AWS Associate certifications (Solutions Architect, SysOps, and Developer). I’m also an experienced educator and presenter.

I am currently a DevOps Developer at Havas Production Studio. I manage Jenkins and Windows servers and code in Python and PowerShell to help smooth the development process.

Previously I was System Administrator at Library of Social Science. Our website has attracted a world-wide audience—exploring the sources and meanings of collective forms of violence. Prior to this, I was an editor, developing email marketing campaigns and online publications. Since 2014 I have been volunteering at Emerald Isle Immigration Center, lending my skills as a teacher and communicator to prepare adult immigrants for their U.S. Citizenship interview.
