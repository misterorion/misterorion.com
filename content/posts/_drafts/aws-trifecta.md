I'm happy to announce that I now hold all three AWS Associate-level certifications. I picked up Solutions Architect back in January and cleared SysOps and Developer on the same day (one in the morning and one in the afternoon).

SysOps was the hardest exam of the three and I put in the most hours studying for this one. I didn't do as well as I had liked on the Networking section. I  did pretty badly on this part, truth be told. Reviewing more scenario questions could have boosted my score. Know how to VPC, people!

The Developer exam was fun to study for. Coming from the [serverless workshop](/wild-rydes/) last week got me useful hand-on experience with DynamoDB, a technology you need to know backward, forwards, and inside-out for the exam. There was very little on the exam with regards to Lambda, but there were a few API questions.

If you are looking for materials to pass the exams I highly recommend LinuxAcademy's courses. I used ACloudGuru for SAA, but I have to say that LinuxAcademy does seem a bit more up to date and the quality of the practice exams is miles ahead of CloudGuru.
