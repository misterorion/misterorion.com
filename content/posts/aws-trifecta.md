I'm happy to announce that I now hold all three AWS Associate-level certifications. I picked up Solutions Architect back in January and cleared SysOps and Developer on the same day (one in the morning and one in the afternoon).<!--more-->

SysOps was definitely the hardest exam of the three and I put in the most hours studying for this one. I didn't do as well as I had liked on the Networking section. I actually did pretty badly on this part, truth be told. I have no doubt that reviewing more scenario questions could have boosted my score by a few percent. Know how to VPC, people!

The Developer exam was fun to study for. Coming from the [serverless workshop]({{< ref "/posts/wild-rydes.md" >}}) last week got me useful hand-on experience with DynamoDB, a technology you really need to know backwards, forwards, and inside out for the exam. There was very little on the exam with regards to Lambda, but there were a few API questions.

If you are looking for materials to pass the exams I highly recommend LinuxAcademy's courses. I used ACloudGuru for SAA, but I have to say that LinuxAcademy does seem a bit more up to date and the quality of the practice exams are miles ahead of CloudGuru.
