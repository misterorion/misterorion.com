Greetings! I'm Orion Anderson, a cloud infrastructure engineer and developer living in NYC.

Currently, I'm working at [Aescape][1], an amazing tech-startup, developing their AWS infrastructure with Pulumi, writing API code in Go, and administering a range of Linux systems.

Previously, I was a Technical Director and DevOps Engineer at [Havas Production Studios][2], managing builds and deployment pipelines in both AWS (CodePipeline) and on-prem (Jenkins), wielding Python, Bash, and PowerShell to smooth the development process. I'm also a volunteer web developer and sysadmin at [Emerald Isle Immigration Center][3]. In my earlier years, I was a sysadmin and email developer at [Library of Social Science][4].
